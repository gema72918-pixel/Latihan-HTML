    <h1>Apple's iPhone 5c isn't the low-cost phone you've been waiting for</h1>

        The iPhone 5c, simply put, is for those who've grown numb to Apple's largely
        evolutionary takes on its primary iPhone range. It'll attract a younger audience
        that cares less about finely beveled edges and more about playing
        <a class="italic-link" href="#">Connect 4</a> on their iPhone case.
        It'll cater to the same
        <a class="green-italic" href="#">crowd that has looked longingly towards</a>
        the $599 (again, off-contract)
        <a href="#">Moto X</a> -- a phone for the mainstream, and a phone that's as colorful
        as one's soul.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a way, this is the anti-Moto X. From a price, spec and feature perspective,
        it's a match that's too close to call. The iPhone 5c's camera
        <span class="red-bold">has an edge on the Moto X</span>, but the X's
        <span class="italic-link">Active Display</span> is a boon for notifications.
        As these things tend to go, a lot of it boils down to ecosystem preference.
        The iPhone 5c is being built for the same audience as the
        <a class="italic-link" href="#">flashy iPod nano</a>, and moreover, Apple built it
        for those on <a href="#">Wall Street</a> who feel that it simply
        <span class="italic-link">must</span> attract new markets to stay atop its game.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <p>
        Apple never showed intentions of racing the <a href="#"><b>Nexus 7</b></a> to the bottom
        in the tablet game, and the <b>iPhone 5c</b> is proof that it won't do that in the
        phone arena, either.
